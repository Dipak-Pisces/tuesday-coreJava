what is interface?
    interface is an reference type, that can contain only abstract methods. static methods, default methods, and constants.
    all methods are abstract by default unless explicitly marked as "defualt"
    constants are treated as "public static final"
    public -> accessible anywhere
    static -> associated with interface, not with an instance
    final -> cannot be changed

What is functional interface?
    functional interfaces are interfaces which have exactly one abstract method
    can have multiple default or static method
    goes hand to hand with lambda expressions.
